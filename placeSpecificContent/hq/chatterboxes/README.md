# CHATTERBOX

## Description
This new and improved chatterbox now comes with privacy mode! That's right, folks: now you too can hide away in a private cubicle on your own island. Or, use it to hold very secret private conversations. We guarantee you will look super stealth with the shades down and door closed.
